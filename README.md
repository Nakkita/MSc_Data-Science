This repository contains the code used for my Masters' Thesis: Counting objects in ecological images.
This repository can be used to:
   1. Estimate the number of objects in aerial images using a Shiny web application tool. This was developed to estimate counts of seabird coloniies in aerial images. However,       it can be applied to other aerial images.
   2. Train deep convolutional neural networks to detect and count objects using the YOLOv3 algorithm. This was developed to detect and count jellyfish, fish and school of fish in       images that were extracted from animal-borne videos. 

# Blob Counter Shiny Application
